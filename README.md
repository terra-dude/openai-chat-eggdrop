# Openai Chat for Eggdrop

The TCL script for an Eggdrop bot that responds to messages starting with "!openai" in a specific channel using the OpenAI API would likely involve several steps:

    Setting up the Eggdrop bot and connecting it to the desired channel.
    Listening for messages in the channel using the Eggdrop TCL command for listening to channel messages.
    Checking if the message starts with "!openai" using TCL string manipulation commands.
    If the message starts with "!openai", using the TCL http package to make a request to the OpenAI API endpoint, passing in the message after "!openai" as the prompt, and providing the API key in the request headers.
    Receiving the response from the OpenAI API and parsing it to extract the generated text.
    Using the Eggdrop TCL command for sending messages to the channel to send the generated text as a response to the user's message.

Here's a example how the script could look like:
